# Source Allies Interviews

This repository contains information about the Source Allies interivew process.

Please see our [careers page](https://www.sourceallies.com/careers/) if you are interested in working on our team!

## Typical Interview Process

Our interview process typically consists of four steps:

1. Meeting You
2. Self Evalutation
3. Coding Exercise
4. In-Person Interview

## Meeting You

## Self Evaluation

## Coding Exercise

## In-Person Interview

The purpose of this interview is to further gauge your technical ability and to get a sense of what itâ€™s like to work with you. 

We use a project to guide our discussion, but we don't have to finish the project. We only need to get far enough along to get a good sense of your technical ability.

To ensure we have a consistent development environment, our interview projects are built around [VS Code dev containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers). Candidates are welcome to bring their own laptop, but please make sure you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed, along with the VS Code [remote container extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).

We typically use C#, Java, JavaScript, or Python for our interview projects. You do not need to be an **expert** in any of those languages, but you should know enough to be able to solve problems.

### Verify Setup

We recognize that not all candidates may be familiar with VS Code, Docker, and/or the remote container extension. That is OK! We have example "check" repos you can use to verify your setup and familiarize yourself with our interview environment:

- [C#](https://github.com/sourceallies/interview-csharp-check)
- [Java](https://github.com/sourceallies/interview-java-check)
- [JavaScript](https://github.com/sourceallies/interview-javascript-check)
- [Python](https://github.com/sourceallies/interview-python-check)
