# Source Allies Interviews

This repository contains information about the Source Allies pairing session process.

Please see our [careers page](https://www.sourceallies.com/careers/) if you are interested in working on our team!

_This repo is part of an active effort to make our pairing session process more transparent. We are continuously improving our interview process to make it more effective._

## Typical Interview Process

Our pairing process typically consists of four steps:

1. Meeting You
2. Self Evalutation
3. A custom [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) coding exercise
4. In-person (or virtual) technical pairing session 

## Meeting You

You’ll meet with a recruiter through a call, virtual hangout, or even a coffee. You will connect and talk about your background, where you would like to grow your career, and what drew you to Source Allies. This conversation is to gain an understanding of initial alignment for both parties.

## Self Evaluation

This document will be a chance for you to tell stories and share with Source Allies a more in-depth snapshot of your experience and perspectives. There will also be a confidential information component that is shared only between you and your recruiter. 

## Coding Exercise

It’s a race against the clock on our custom built algorithmic coding exercise via HackerRank to get a better glimpse of your technical capabilities. The test consists of front and backend question options, and a variety of languages, frameworks, and libraries to utilize. Are you up for the challenge?

## Pairing Session

The purpose of this interview is to further gauge your technical ability and to get a sense of what it’s like to work with you. 

We use a project to guide our discussion, but we don't have to finish the project. We only need to get far enough along to get a good sense of your technical ability.

To ensure we have a consistent development environment, our interview projects are built around [VS Code dev containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers). Candidates are welcome to bring their own laptop, but please make sure you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed, along with the VS Code [remote container extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).

We typically use C#, Java, JavaScript, or Python for our interview projects. You do not need to be an **expert** in any of those languages, but you should know enough to be able to solve problems.

To create a positive experience for virtual pairing sessions, please have a reliable camera, audio, and sound ready.

### Verify Setup

We recognize that not all candidates may be familiar with VS Code, Docker, and/or the remote container extension. That is OK! We have example "check" repos you can use to verify your setup and familiarize yourself with our interview environment:

- [C#](https://github.com/sourceallies/interview-csharp-check)
- [Java](https://github.com/sourceallies/interview-java-check)
- [JavaScript](https://github.com/sourceallies/interview-javascript-check)
- [Python](https://github.com/sourceallies/interview-python-check)
